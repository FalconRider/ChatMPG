Chat-Multi Poly Glot - A DuoLingo Distortion. Learn 10 languages at once, just the easy conversations.

I'm retired and have a lot of time to keep up with  tech and these are exciting times. 
Last year I  earneds a TESOL certificate  from ASU Arizona state University, online, on Coursera. took about  four months.  It basically teaches how to teach not just the  English language to speakers of other languages, but teaching  anything  in general.  Principles such as focus on topic, recall, reinforcement, and repetion and building from a base.
I plan to teach adults, private or  very small group, business or tech English, since that's my background.
So this year, not sure of where to travel or who to teach and knowing that a few phrases of a native language may make a stdent feel at home. I decided to pick up some basic " Tourist Level " capabilties.
I also need to keep up with my tech, and the hottest thing in tech right now is programing thru an LLM driven Chatbot.    

So here are a series of progressive, Webpage apps, that teach conversational languages. 
Each is small - less than 10 k - yes K , an easy attachment to an email. You down load it and open it in
chrome. Book mark it . Not web driven, all the code , HTML, CSS, Javascript in one .html file -  (per session) I DID NOT WRITE THE CODE. chatGPT4 wrote based on my conversations with it.   Those are also included as text files or an archive. OPEN AI's CHATGPT 4  tells me I own the rights to this code. I did subscribe for $20 a month.  This is a work in progress and a non commercial project for my amusement and education. ChatGPT and I may make mistakes. 

How to use - I think this will work

DL the Elevator.html script
Navigate to where it downloaded.
Click on the file to open in Chrome - 
Android Phone and Chromebook work, Desktop has a TTL problem I have to look in to  and I don't do Apple.

Hit the language button to cycle thru 10 languages to get the equivalent in native text, and then spoken TTS.  IMHO: This is the most common encounter  - you step into an Elevator, there is a stranger, in English you would say "Hi, How are you?" that's it a mere acknowlagent of existance. Same with passing someone in the street.  BUT now you can say it in  10 languages. It's also the into for othe convos like ordering in a Restaaurant or Bar, which is the second file.

You go thru all ten languages first, to hear the answer, second pass, guess to see if you rememberd.
Hit languge button to go to the next  language   or twice  to skip any your not interested in, Hit Answer button repeatedly to get repeated voicings till your happy you can do it.
